## Project Background
 This Banking_Report_Analysis project involved building an interactive banking dashboard in Power BI to
 simulate real-world financial reporting. The dashboard consolidates key bank metrics—such as client count,
 loan balances, deposit volumes, and fee income—into a unified view. In practice, Power BI is used to
 centralize disparate financial data and present it in clear visual form. To support hands-on learning, this
 project uses anonymized/sample data rather than real customer data.
 
 ## Executive Summary
 
 
 At a high level, the dashboard reveals the bank’s overall performance. The home view (Overall Dashboard
 Summary) shows total clients (about 2,940) alongside the total loan portfolio ($4.38 B) and total deposits
 ($3.77 B). Fee income (~$158M) and other key balances (credit cards, savings) are highlighted in KPI cards.
 Interactive buttons enable drill-downs into Loan Analysis, Deposit Analysis, and detailed Summary tabs. By
 presenting data visually, the dashboard lets executives quickly compare loan vs. deposit volumes and see
 revenue contributions. As one industry source notes, Power BI dashboards can translate “complex financial
 data into clear and compelling visual representations,” making trends easier to spot. 

 For example, the Loan vs. Deposit comparison shows the loan book exceeds deposits, hinting at liquidity
 considerations. The Fee metric underscores the bank’s non-interest revenue. Filters (e.g. by gender or
 relationship type) allow slicing by segment. These interactive visuals help management “identify
 opportunities and make strategic decisions” by turning raw numbers into intuitive charts. In summary,
 the dashboard offers a concise snapshot of customer engagement and financial health, supporting data
driven insights for the bank.

## Summary of Insights

  ####   • **Total Clients** : 2,940 across all segments (from the dashboard summary). 
   ####   • Loan Portfolio: $4.38 B total. Breakdown: Business lending is largest ($1.17 B), Bank loans $814M, while Credit Cards are minimal (~$4.3M). 
  
   ####    • Deposit Portfolio: ~$3.77 B total. Breakdown: Bank deposits ~$925M, Checking accounts $435M,Savings ~$324M, Foreign currency ~$41M.
   ####   • Fee Income: ~$158.2 M (revenue from fees and services). 
  ####    • By Income Band: Mid-income customers hold the largest share of funds (loans $442M; deposits $510M). Low-income and high-income groups account for smaller portions ($202M and $170M in loans respectively). This emphasizes the importance of customer segmentation, as focusing on the  mid-income bracket could yield significant impact . 
    
   ####   • By Nationality: European customers dominate assets (loan ~$358M, deposit ~$770M). Asians and  Americans follow, while Australian and African segments are smaller. This suggests tailored products for the strong European base, and growth potential in other nationalities
   
####      • Customer Engagement: Longer-tenured clients hold most balances. For instance, customers with <20 years of relationship account for ~$0.75 B in loans and ~$0.67 B in deposits. Newer clients (<5–10  years) have lower balances. This highlights retention’s role: keeping existing customers is key to maintaining volume.
    
   ####   These insights align with industry knowledge that analyzing customer segments (by income, nationality,tenure) is critical for personalization and cross-selling . The data shows where the bank’s portfolio is concentrated and which segments merit strategic focus.

 
## Recommendations

### • Target Mid-Income Segment :
   Develop marketing campaigns and tailored products (loans, savings
   plans) for middle-income customers, since they hold the bulk of funds. Data-driven personalization
   can boost this effort; industry best practices show segment-focused offers improve cross-selling . 
 
### • Enhance Customer Retention :
 Introduce loyalty programs or relationship incentives for newer
 clients (<5–10 years), who currently have smaller balances. Engaging these clients (with e.g.
 promotions or bundled services) may grow their deposits and lending over time. 
 
### • Leverage Nationality Trends :
Strengthen services for key demographics. For example, deepen
 European client relationships through personalized offerings, and create targeted outreach to
 expand in underrepresented nationalities. Analytics suggests banks can “forecast customer
 behaviors and preferences, enhancing their ability to personalize services”, so segment-specific
 strategies are recommended. 
 
### • Balance Loan/Deposit Growth :
 Since loans exceed deposits, consider strategies to attract more
 deposits (e.g. higher savings rates or new deposit products) to improve liquidity ratios. A balanced
 portfolio will support sustainable lending. 
 
### • Expand Fee-Based Services :
 Given the notable fee income, the bank could explore new fee
 generating products (like premium accounts or advisory services) to further diversify revenue
 streams.
 
Overall, these actions should be guided by the dashboard’s data, ensuring that business decisions are informed by the insights shown
